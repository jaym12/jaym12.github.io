## Hello World

I am very excited to have my blog up and running! My name is J, and i am an aspiring web developer based out of Austin, Texas. I have created this blog to document my learning as a way of deeping my own understanding as well as giving back tutorials and resources to the community.

I have been using pretty much every resource in my journey to learn web development, but i am tracking my progress primaryily by freeCodeCamp and a Udemy course The Web Developers Bootcamp.

Thank you very much for stopping by, feel free to leave a comment below or reach out to me via my contact page.

XOXO
J
